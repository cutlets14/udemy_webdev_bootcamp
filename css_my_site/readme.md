- Block vs. in-line display elements.

  - Block elements take up the entire width of the page e.g.,

    ,

    <div>
    </div>

  - In-line elements only take up the width of their contents e.g.,

    <span>, <a>
    </a></span>

    - [Cannot change width of in-line elements]()

    []()

  [- Display value of elements can be modified between block and in-line]()

  []() [- Inline-block elements gives the best of both worlds i.e. allow elements to sit on the same line but also allow the elements' widths to be modified

  - Treat ![]() as if they were inline-block elements

- Display type of none gets rid of the element

  - visibility of hidden keeps the element there but hides it from view such that other elements flow around them]()
