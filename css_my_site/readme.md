- Block vs. in-line display elements.
    - Block elements take up the entire width of the page e.g., <p>, <div>
    - In-line elements only take up the width of their contents e.g., <span>, <a>
        - Cannot change width of in-line elements
    - Display value of elements can be modified between block and in-line
- Inline-block elements gives the best of both worlds i.e. allow elements to sit on the same line but also allow the elements' widths to be modified
    - Treat <img> as if they were inline-block elements
- Display type of none gets rid of the element
    - visibility of hidden keeps the element there but hides it from view such that other elements flow around them
