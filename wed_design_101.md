# Color Theory

## Understanding Color Theory

### Color Palette

- Beware of the color palette as it sets the mood for the message

  - Red - love, energy, intensity
  - Yellow - joy, intellect, attention
  - Green - freshness, safety, growth
  - Blue - stability, trust, serenity
  - Purple - royalty, wealth, femininity

- Analogous colors - introduce harmony when choosing two colors next to each other on a color palette

- Complementary colors - make things pop by choosing two colors on opposite ends on a color palette

  - Do not try to style text/backgrounds with complementary colors
  - Stick to logos or icons

### Typography

- Font family

  - Serif - "little feet" at the end of letters

    - Come across as traditional, stable, authoritative
    - Lots of sub-families e.g., old style, transitional, modern
    - The contemporary typeface has a more drastic difference between the thick and thin parts of the font

  - Sans serif - do not have the "little feet"

    - Sensible, simple, straightforward
    - Lots of start-ups love using sans serif typefaces

- Find fonts with similar moods and sourced from similar time eras

- Use serif-ness and weights to introduce contrast between fonts

### UI Design

- Introduce a hierarchy to determine which information gets conveyed first
- Color - draw attention to what users should look at
- Size - bigger items draw attention
- Layout - Wikipedia is not a great design when it comes to layout; Grammarly has a good layout
- Alignment - positioning elements on the screen relative to each other helps introduce flow to the message; **easy way to make things look professional is to reduce the number of alignment points**
- Whitespace - spacing things out introduces clarity and makes the product look more refined (can probably charge more money :smile:)
- Audience - design for your audience

### UX Design

- What exactly is UX design?

  - How the product is designed such that it affords an intuitive, effortless experience for the users.

- What is required for good UX design?

  - Simplicity - always try to pare down your design
  - Consistency - always keep your experience consistent to prevent users from having to re-learn how to use each page
  - Reading Patterns - use the F-layout or the Z-layout
  - Think about all platform design - account for mobile responsiveness
  - Test, test, test
  - Don't use your powers for evil - avoid dark patterns
